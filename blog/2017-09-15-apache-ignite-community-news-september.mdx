This is our third community update. There's a lot going on, so let's get started.

Apache Ignite experts have already spoken at two meetups this month, both in Silicon Valley, but there are several more scheduled this month around the world.

On **Sept. 9** Apache Ignite PMC chair Denis Magda was the featured presenter at the **[Big Data and Cloud Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/datariders/events/242523245/)** in Santa Clara, Calif. His talk, titled "Apache Spark and Apache Ignite: Where Fast Data Meets the IoT," was highly rated and we're planning a hands-on workshop with meetup organizers for November.

On **Sept. 13** Denis also spoke at the **[SF Big Analytics Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Big-Analytics/events/242368299/)** in Mountain View, Calif. Again, to a packed room. The topic of his talk was "Better Machine Learning with Apache Ignite."

But Denis isn't having all the fun. Next Monday *(Sept. 18)*, technology evangelist Akmal Chaudhri will speak at the Camidge .NET User Group. The title of his talk: "**[Scale Out and Conquer: Apache Ignite for .NET Users](https://www.meetup.com/Camidge-NET-User-Group/events/238837204/)**."

We're still looking for more meetups to speak at this month, so if you're an organizer or would like us to speak at one you're a member of, just let me know. In the meantime, here are the meetups planned for the remainder of September:

- [Bay Area In-Memory Computing Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/Bay-Area-In-Memory-Computing/events/242961495), Wednesday, Sept. 20 - Denis will present, "Apache Spark, Ignite and Flink: Where Fast Data Meets the IoT."
- [Internet of Things (IoT) New York Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/IoT-NY), Monday, Sept. 25 - Akmal will present, "Apache Spark and Apache Ignite: Where Fast Data Meets the IoT."
- [NYC In-Memory Computing Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/NYC-In-Memory-Computing-Meetup/events/243150945), Tuesday, Sept. 26 - Akmal will present, "Powering Up Banks and Financial Institutions with Distributed Systems."
- [New York Kubernetes Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/New-York-Kubernetes-Meetup/events/242597746), Wednesday, Sept. 27 - Akmal will provide a DevOps perspective on the orchestration of distributed databases and Apache Ignite.

See? I told you Denis wasn't having all the fun! Akmal is definitely on the road again.

### Webinars

- [Implementing In-Memory Computing for Financial Services Use Cases with Apache Ignite](http://bigcommunity.net/big-tv/) Sept 12 *(recording available)*
- [Better Machine Learning with Apache Ignite](https://www.gridgain.com/company/news/events/better-machine-learning-with-apacher-ignitetm), Wednesday, Sept. 27

### Blog posts

On Sept. 5, Akmal published "[Using Java and .NET apps to connect to an Apache Ignite cluster](https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/using-java-and-net-apps-connect-apache-ignite-cluster), that details how to create an Apache Ignite cluster that can support the reading and writing of user-defined objects in a common storage format. This is particularly useful in situations where applications need to work with objects but these objects will be accessed by different programming languages and frameworks.

On Sept. 7, Dmitriy Setrakyan published "[Apache Ignite - In Memory Performance with Durability of Disk.](http://gridgain.blogspot.com/2017/09/apache-ignite-in-memory-performance.html)"

Next up, on Sept. 12, was Akmal, who published "[Kubernetes and Apache Ignite Deployment on AWS](https://www.gridgain.com/resources/blog/kubernetes-and-apacher-ignitetm-deployment-aws)." That post walked through the steps required to get Kubernetes and Apache Ignite deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

And then on Sept. 13 Dmitriy published "[What is Apache Ignite](http://gridgain.blogspot.com/2017/09/what-is-apache-ignite.html)." I think the headline of that one is self-explanatory.

### In the news

Nikita Ivanov is also an InfoWorld contributor. Read the first in his series on in-memory computing, "[Ensuring big data and fast data performance with in-memory computing](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3224449/big-data/ensuring-big-data-and-fast-data-performance-with-in-memory-computing.html#tk.rss_bigdata)."
