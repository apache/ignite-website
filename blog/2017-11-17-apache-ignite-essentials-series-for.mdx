We finally made this happen! I'm happy to invite all of the software architects and engineers out there to a series of webinars that will introduce you to the fundamental capabilities of in-memory computing platforms such as Apache Ignite.

There will also be a mix of theory and practice. A lot of code examples are waiting to be shown so that you can apply the theory in practice right away.

The series consists of two parts.

### [Part 1: Tuesday, November 21, 2017, 11:00am PT / 2:00pm ET](https://ignite.apache.org/events.html#in-memory-computing-essentials-architects-and-developers-part-1)

To be covered:

- Cluster configuration and deployment.
- Distributed database internals (partitioning, replication).
- Data processing with key-value APIs.
- Affinity Collocation.
- Data processing with SQL.
