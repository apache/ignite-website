Apache Ignite community welcomes you to attend [Big Data Bootcamp](http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp/event-79.html) on March 27th, 28th and 29th 2017 in Santa Clara, USA.

The conference gathers experts and vendors from Big Data realm in sunny California who will be covering a variety of Big Data products and technologies, including, but not limited to, Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning.

Apache Ignite will be introduced at the conference by its PMC chair and committer - Denis Magda.

As all we know, in-memory data grids bring exceptional performance and scalability gains to applications built on top of them. The applications truly achieve 10x more performance improvement and become easily scalable and fault-tolerant thanks to the unique data grids architecture. However, because of this particular architecture, a majority of data grids have to sacrifice traditional SQL support requiring application developers to completely rewrite their SQL-based code to support data grid specific APIs. This, however, is not true for Apache Ignite.

In this presentation, Denis will introduce Apache Ignite SQL Grid component that combines the best of two worlds - performance and scalability of data grids and traditional ANSI-99 SQL support of relational databases. Moreover, Denis will take an existing application that works with a relational database and will show how to run it on top of Apache Ignite with minimum efforts.

The talk is called **["Apache Ignite SQL Grid: Hot Blend of Traditional SQL and Swift Data Grid"](http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp-79/speaker-details/denis-magda-41504.html)** and takes place at 1:00 PM - 1:40PM on March 28. Refer to [Big Data Bootcamp's agenda](http://globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/big-data-bootcamp/schedule-79.html) for more details.
