            "summary": "You can scale out your database, add more nodes, and tune every index, but if your data isn’t in the right place, performance still hits a wall. Every distributed system eventually runs into this: joins that cross the network, caches that can’t keep up, and queries that feel slower the larger your cluster gets.",
