            Hibernate stores data in first-level (L1) cache to minimize expensive database requests. However,
            this data is cached per Hibernate session and is not shared among threads. A common solution here is
            to configure a second-level (L2) cache.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ignite In-Memory Data Grid can be plugged in as Hibernate second-level (L2) cache.
            Accessible by all sessions, Ignite Data Grid can significantly accelerate the performance of your
            application by reducing the data access time.
        </p>
        <h2>How Hibernate Caching Works</h2>
        <p>
            Hibernate first-level (L1) cache is associated with the session object, the scope of which
            is limited to a single session. Objects cached in one session are not shared with another,
            which means that a request for the same entity by another session
            will still go to the database.
        </p>
            
            
        <h2>Ignite as Hibernate L2 Cache</h2>
        <p>
            To overcome the issue of per-session cache, a global second-level (L2) cache can be configured,
            in which cached objects are visible to all sessions. This usually gives a significantly greater
            performance gain since each newly created session now has access to the data already present in
            the L2 cache memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apache Ignite can be plugged-in as Hibernate L2 cache implementation, and can be used in all access
            modes - <code>READ_ONLY</code>, <code>READ_WRITE</code>, <code>NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE</code>, and
            <code>TRANSACTIONAL</code>, supporting a wide range of related features:
        <ul class="page-list">
            <li>On-Heap and Off-Heap in-memory stores, as well as disk overflow.</li>
            <li>Cache transactions, that make <code>TRANSACTIONAL</code> mode possible.</li>
            <li>Clustering, with 2 different replication modes: <code>REPLICATED</code> and <code>PARTITIONED</code></li>
        </ul>
