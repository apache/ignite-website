<div class="container">
        <p>
            Apache Ignite enables high-performance computing by providing APIs for data and
            compute-intensive calculations. The APIs implement the MapReduce paradigm and let you run
            arbitrary tasks across the cluster of Ignite nodes. High-performance computing (HPC) is the ability to
            process data and
            perform complex calculations at high speeds and with Ignite you can turn your commodity hardware or cloud
            environment into a distributed supercomputer.
        </p>
        <img class="diagram-right img-fluid" src="/images/collocated_processing.png"/>
        <p>
            Having Ignite as a high-performance compute cluster, you can turn a group of commodity
            machines or a cloud environment into a distributed supercomputer of interconnected Ignite
            nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ignite enables speed and scale for HPC scenarios by processing records in memory and reducing
            data shuffling and network utilization.
        </p>


        <h2>Co-located Processing</h2>
        <p>
            Ignite uses the notion of co-located processing to guide HPC workloads implementations in distributed
            in-memory environments. Co-located processing increases the performance of your complex calculations by
            running them straight on the Ignite cluster nodes. These calculations are done only on local data sets
            available on the nodes, thus avoiding data shuffling over the network and resulting in orders of magnitude
            increase in performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            To exploit the co-located processing in practice, first, you need to co-locate data by storing related
            records on the same cluster node. As an example of related or co-located data, consider your bank account
            and transactions posted to it. Once you set <code>accountID</code> as an affinity key for the
            <code>Transactions</code> table, you'll instruct Ignite to store all transactions for your
            <code>accountId</code> on the same node that keeps the record of your account in the
            <code>Accounts</code> table. Now let's say a payment processing system sends a compute task that
            verifies previous transactions of your account. Since the data is co-located, Ignite will execute this
            task directly on the node that stores your account record with all completed transactions and finish the
            verification locally on that machine instead of pulling all the transactions back to the application
            over the network. This method of executing a task on the node where the data resides provides
            exceptionally high performance.The effect is even more significant when the system needs to process
            millions of transactions per second, verifying billions of previously completed payments.
        </p>

        <h2>Compute APIs</h2>

        <p>
            Ignite provides compute APIs (also known as compute grid) for creating and scheduling custom
            tasks of arbitrary complexity. The APIs implement MapReduce paradigm and are presently available for Java,
            C#, and C++.
