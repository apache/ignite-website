      <p>
          Apache Ignite enables real-time analytics across operational and historical silos for
          existing Apache Hadoop deployments by serving as an in-memory computing platform designated for
          low-latency and high-throughput operations while Hadoop continues to be used for long-running
          OLAP workloads.
      </p>
      <img class="diagram-right img-fluid" src="/images/hadoop-acceleration.png"/>
      
      <p>
          As the architecture diagram on the right suggests, you can achieve the performance acceleration
          of Hadoop-based systems by deploying Ignite as a separate distributed storage that keeps data
          sets needed for your low-latency operations or real-time reports.
      </p>

      
            <p>
                First, depending on the data volume and available memory capacity, you can enable Ignite native persistence to
                store historical data sets on disk while dedicating a memory space for operational records. You can
                continue to use Hadoop as storage for less frequently used data or for long-running and ad-hoc
                analytical queries.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, as the architecture suggests, your applications and services should use Ignite native APIs to
                process the data residing in the in-memory cluster. Ignite provides SQL, compute (aka. map-reduce),
                and machine learning APIs for various data processing needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, consider using Apache Spark DataFrames APIs if an application needs to run federated or
                cross-database across Ignite and Hadoop clusters. Ignite is integrated with Spark, which natively
                supports Hive/Hadoop. Cross-database queries should be considered only for a limited number of
                scenarios when neither Ignite nor Hadoop contains the entire data set.
            </p>					
      
            
					<h2>How to split data and operations between Ignite and Hadoop?</h2>
            <p>
                Consider using this approach:
            </p>
            <ul >
                <li>
                    Use Apache Ignite for tasks that require low-latency response time (microseconds,
                    milliseconds, seconds), high throughput operations (thousands and millions of
                    operations per second), and real-time processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue using Apache Hadoop for high-latency operations (dozens of seconds, minutes, hours) and
                    batch processing.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            
            <h2>Getting Started Checklist</h2>
            <p>
                Follow the steps below to implement the discussed architecture in practice:
            </p>
            <ul >
                <li>
                    Download and install Apache Ignite in your system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select a list of operations/reports to be executed against Ignite. The best candidates are
                    operations that require low-latency response time, high-throughput, and real-time analytics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Depending on the data volume and available memory space, consider using Ignite native
                    persistence. Alternatively, you can use Ignite as a pure in-memory cache or in-memory data grid
                    that persists changes to Hadoop or another external database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Update your applications to ensure they use Ignite native APIs to process Ignite data and Spark
                    for federated queries.
                </li>
            </ul>
