					 <h1>Building Digital Integration Hub <stron>With Apache Ignite</stron></h1>
            <img class="diagram-right img-fluid" src="/images/digital-hub.png"/>
                    <p>
                        A digital integration hub (DIH) is an advanced platform architecture that aggregates multiple
                        back-end systems and databases into a low-latency and shared data store. Apache Ignite can
                        function as this high-performance shared store by caching and persisting data sets dispersed
                        across many disjointed external databases and systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Applications typically access Ignite via an API service layer and get substantial performance
                        growth by requesting data from only this distributed store, which keeps all the records in
                        memory and offloads the back-end systems.
                    </p>
                
					<p>
              The primary purpose of Ignite as a DIH component is:
          </p>
            <ul>
                <li>to enable implementations of large-scale and high-throughput architectures that prevent the back-end
                    systems from getting overwhelmed with excessive workloads</li>
                <li>to avoid complex integrations between the back-end databases and the front-end API services</li>
            </ul>
				
            <h2>Synchronization of Apache Ignite and Back-End Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Ignite, as the high-performance data store, needs to be synchronized with the back-end databases via
                streaming, event-based, change data capture (CDC), or other techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ignite provides the <code>CacheStore</code> interface for uni-directional synchronization between an
                Ignite cluster and an external store supporting relational databases and some NoSQL stores. The interface
                allows Ignite to write-through or write-behind all the changes to the backend-systems automatically.
                It also includes transactions - Ignite coordinates and commits a transaction across its in-memory
                cluster as well as an external transactional database.
            </p>

            <p>
                For bi-directional synchronization, you can consider various streaming, CDC, and event-based technologies.
                For instance, Kafka, Spark, and Debezium are widely used to keep Ignite in sync with other databases.
            </p>					
        
            <h2>Real-Time Analytics</h2>
            		<p>
                		Although real-time analytics is not a defining characteristic of digital integration hub architectures, in some situations, you can end up consolidating operational and analytical data silos in Apache Ignite. If this happens, you can tap into Ignite SQL, compute, and machine learning capabilities for real-time analytics needs.
