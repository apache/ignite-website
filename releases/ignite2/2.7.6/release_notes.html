        <h2>Ignite:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Changed default persistence directory location when IGNITE_HOME is not set, native persistence files will not be stored in the temp directory anymore</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that caused a SELECT query with an equality predicate on a part of the primary compound key to return a single row even if the query matched multiple rows</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue that could cause data corruption during checkpointing</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where a row size was calculated incorrectly for shared cache groups, which caused a tree corruption</li>
            <li>Reduced java heap footprint by optimizing GridDhtPartitionsFullMessage maps in exchange history</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue where an outdated node with a destroyed cache caused the cluster to hang</li>
            <li> Fixed a bug that made it impossible to change the inline_size property of an existing index after it was dropped and recreated with a different value</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue causing silent control.sh script fail when JAVA_HOME is not set</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue causing sporadic node failure when persistence is enabled and WAL mmap is disabled</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue causing potential PDS corruption when a node is killed during checkpoint mark phase</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ignite .NET:</h2>
