     This banner is automatically added to all the website pages except for the `download.html`. Update the `download.html`
     page separately.

     How to set the `event_category` tag:
        1) Use 'ignite_tech_talk' for the promo of events (conference, meetup and other technical talks).
        2) Use 'announcement' if you promote a new release or anything else unrelated to events.
