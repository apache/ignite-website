p
  | As promised in my&nbsp;
  a(href='https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/protecting-apache-ignite-from-meltdown') initial blog post
  |  on this matter, Apache Ignite community&nbsp;applied security patches against the notorious Meltdown Spectre vulnerabilities and completed performance testing of general operations and workloads that are typical for Ignite deployments.
p
  | The security patches were applied only for&nbsp;
  a(href='https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754' target='_blank') CVE-2017-5754
  | &nbsp;(Meltdown) and&nbsp;
  a(href='https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753' target='_blank') CVE-2017-5753
  | &nbsp;(Spectre Variant 1) vulnerabilities. The patches for&nbsp;
  a(href='https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715' target='_blank') CVE-2017-5715
  | &nbsp;(Spectre Variant 2) for the hardware the community used for testing are not stable yet an can 
  a(href='https://newsroom.intel.com/news/root-cause-of-reboot-issue-identified-updated-guidance-for-customers-and-partners/' target='_blank') cause system reboot issues or another unpredictable behavior
  | .&nbsp;

p
  
  | The applied patches have shown that the performance implications&nbsp;are negligible - the performance drop is just in the 0 - 7% range as the figure shows:

p
  
  | Thus, Apache Ignite community highly recommends its customers and partners to consider&nbsp;security patches for&nbsp;CVE-2017-5754&nbsp;(Meltdown) and&nbsp;CVE-2017-5753&nbsp;(Spectre Variant 1) in their deployment environments and contact us on the user list if you run into a larger performance drop in your use case.
  
p
  
  | At the same time, we&apos;re keeping an eye on Intel announcements and will validate the performance implications of Spectre Variant 2 once a solution is released by the hardware vendor.
