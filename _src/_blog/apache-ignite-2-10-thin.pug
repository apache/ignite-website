  | As of March 15, 2021, 
  a(href='https://ignite.apache.org/') Apache Ignite
  |  2.10 has been released. You can directly
  |     check the full list of resolved 
  a(href='https://s.apache.org/i3ny6') Important JIRA&apos;s
  |  but here let&rsquo;s briefly overview some valuable improvements.
h3#thin-clients Thin Clients
| Thin clients now support several important features which, previously were available only on the thick clients.
|     Thin clients are always backward and forward compatible with the server nodes of the cluster, so the cluster upgrade
|     process will be more convenient if the lack of these features prevented you from doing that.
p See the list of what is changed for thin clients below:
ul
  li Transactions
  li Service invocations
  li Continuous Queries
  li SQL API
  li Cluster API
  li Cache Async API
  li
    | Kubernetes Discovery (
    em ThinClientKubernetesAddressFinder
    | )

a(href='https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/Thin+clients+features') List of Thin Client Features
|     that supported by platforms you are interested in or see the

| .
h3#cluster-monitoring Cluster Monitoring
| Apache Ignite self-monitoring and cluster health check subsystems are also extended by additional SQL-views
|     and command line scripts.

h4#managing-ignite-system-properties Managing Ignite System Properties
p
  | In addition to basic cluster configuration settings, you can perform some low-level cluster configuration and tuning
  | via
  | Ignite system properties. Run the command below to see the list of all available system properties for
  | configuration:

code 
  pre $./ ignite.sh -systemProps
  br
  pre --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  pre IGNITE_AFFINITY_HISTORY_SIZE           - [Integer] Maximum size for affinity assignment history. Default is 25.
  pre IGNITE_ALLOW_ATOMIC_OPS_IN_TX          - [Boolean] Allows atomic operations inside transactions. Default is true.
  pre IGNITE_ALLOW_START_CACHES_IN_PARALLEL  - [Boolean] Allows to start multiple caches in parallel. Default is true.

h3#cluster-profiling Cluster Profiling
| From now on, Apache Ignite is delivered with the cluster profiling tool. This tool collects and processes all cluster
|     internal information about Queries, Compute Tasks, Cache operations, Checkpoint and WAL statistics, and so on for
|     problem detection and cluster self-tuning purposes. Each cluster node collects performance statistics into a special
|     binary file that is placed under the 
code [IGINTE_WORK_DIR]/perf_stat/
|  directory with the template filename
|     as
code node-[nodeId]-[index].prf
| .
|     All these files are consumed by offline-tool that builds the report in a human-readable format.

h3#transparent-data-encryption-cache-key-rotation Transparent Data Encryption - Cache Key Rotation
| Payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) requires that key-management procedures include a predefined
|     crypto period for each key in use and define a process for key changes at the end of the defined crypto period.
|     An expired key should not be used to encrypt new data, but it can be used for archived data, such keys should be
|     strongly protected (section 3.5 - 3.6 of PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures).
p Apache Ignite now supports full PCI DSS requirements:
ul
  li
    em Transparent Data Encryption
    |  available since the 2.7 release.
  li
    em Master Key Rotation
    |  procedure available since the 2.9 release.
  li
    em Cache Key Rotation
    |  procedure available since the 2.10 release.
| You may use the CLI tools that provide the ability to change the re-encryption rate as well as suspend and
|     resume background re-encryption at runtime.
