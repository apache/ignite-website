  | The world was rocked after the recent disclosure of the 
  a(href='https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2018/1/4/16850004/meltdown-spectre-intel-security-flaw-update' target='_blank') Meltdown and Spectre
  |  vulnerabilities that literally affect almost all software ever developed. Both issues are related to the way all modern CPUs are designed and this is why they have opened&nbsp;unprecedented security breaches -- making the software, including Apache Ignite, vulnerable to hacker&nbsp;attacks.
p
  | The vulnerabilities are registered in the National Vulnerability Database under the following CVEs:

ul
  li
    a(href='https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753' target='_blank') CVE-2017-5753
    |  &mdash; Spectre variant 1
  li
    a(href='https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715' target='_blank') CVE-2017-5715
    |  &mdash; Spectre variant 2
  li
    a(href='https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754' target='_blank') CVE-2017-5754
    |  &mdash; Meltdown

h2 How to protect Apache Ignite deployments?
p
p
p
  | First, the vulnerabilities can be fixed only on the operating system (OS) or hardware levels. All OS and hardware vendors are working on and releasing patches to fill-in the security breaches. Depending on the type of your Apache Ignite deployment, make sure to do the following:
p
p
ul
  br
  li
    strong On-premise deployments
    |  - apply the patches prepared by your OS and hardware vendors. Consult with them to find out additional steps to act on. 
    a(href='https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-004A' target='_blank') This page
    |  is a good place to start with.
  br
  li
    strong Cloud deployments
    |  - major cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft are in a process of patching their cloud computing services. Consider a cloud provider&apos;s security announcements and recommendations or follow up with a representative for suggestions.
  br
p
p
p
  | Second, an Apache Ignite cluster becomes vulnerable to the attacks only if someone gets unauthorized access to cluster machines (both on-premise or cloud deployments) and executes a malicious shell script or connects to the cluster directly and executes a Java, .NET or C++ computation there.
p
p
p Do the following to prevent this from happening:
p
p
ul
  br
  li
    | Make sure the cluster machines are secured with a hard-to-guess or hard-to-calculate password.
  br
  li
    | Consider using 3rd party security components provided by enterprise vendors (such as 
    a(href='https://docs.gridgain.com/docs/security-and-audit' target='_blank') this one
    | ) to strengthen a security shield of your deployments.
  br
p
p
p
  | Finally, researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre have said that the first issue can be fixed with software patches while the second can be fully addressed only with hardware upgrades/replacement. Luckily, it&apos;s&nbsp;much more difficult for hackers to exploit Spectre. Thus, if the two recommendations given above are taken seriously, the chances that you will be impacted from Spectre are low.

p
h2 What is the performance impact of security patches?
p
p
p
  | Many security patches are rolled out with a precaution that some of the applications can see up to a 30% performance degradation. Apache Ignite community is planning to measure the impact of general usage scenarios and will follow up with the results in a consequent post.
p
p
p
  | This general performance testing might not cover your use case. Therefore, it&apos;s highly recommended that you assess and test a possible performance drop of your Apache Ignite deployments before applying the patches in production. If the drop is significant, then contact us on the 
  a(href='https://ignite.apache.org/community/resources.html#mail-lists' target='_blank') dev list
