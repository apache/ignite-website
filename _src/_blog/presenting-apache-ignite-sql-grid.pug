  | As all we know, in-memory data grids bring exceptional performance and scalability gains to applications built on top of them. The applications truly achieve 10x more performance improvement and become easily scalable and fault-tolerant thanks to the unique data grids architecture. However, because of this particular architecture, a majority of data grids have to sacrifice traditional SQL support requiring application developers to completely rewrite their SQL-based code to support data grid specific APIs. This, however, is not true for Apache Ignite.

p
  | In this presentation, Denis will introduce Apache Ignite SQL Grid component that combines the best of two worlds - performance and scalability of data grids and traditional ANSI-99 SQL support of relational databases. Moreover, Denis will take an existing application that works with a relational database and will show how to run it on top of Apache Ignite with minimum efforts.
