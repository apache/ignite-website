p
  | Putting aside the regular bug fixes and performance optimizations, the Apache Ignite 2.3 release brings new SQL capabilities and Ignite persistence improvements that are worth mentioning.
p
h3 SQL
p
p Let&apos;s start with SQL first.
p
  | Apache Ignite users have consistently told us that despite all of Ignite&rsquo;s SQL capabilities, it&rsquo;s been at times challenging trying to figure out how to start using Ignite as an SQL database.
p
  | This was mostly caused by scattered documentation pages, lack of &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; guides and tutorials. We&rsquo;ve remedied this oversight! All related SQL knowledge has been curated in a 
  a(href='https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs' target='_blank') single documentation domain
  | .
p
  | Are you curious about the SQL scope? Go to the new 
  a(href='https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/sql-reference-overview' target='_blank') SQL Reference Overview
  |  section!
p
  | Cannot wait to learn how the Ignite SQL engine runs internally? We&rsquo;ve prepared an 
  a(href='https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/how-ignite-sql-works' target='_blank') Architectural Overview
  |  section for you.
p
  | Simply need to know how to connect to an Ignite cluster from an SQL tool? Here is a 
  a(href='https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/how-ignite-sql-works' target='_blank') tooling
  |  section for you.
p Let&rsquo;s take a look at some specific SQL features released in Ignite 2.3. 
p
  | First, we&rsquo;re proud to deliver support of 
  a(href='https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/alter-table' target='_blank') ALTER TABLE
  |  command. Presently, the command allows adding new columns to an SQL schema in runtime -- avoiding any cluster restarts. Once a new column is added, it can be turned into an index. Again, in runtime. No restarts!
p
  | Another significant addition seen in Ignite 2.3 is the integration with 
  a(href='https://apacheignite-sql.readme.io/docs/sqlline' target='_blank') SQLLine tool
  |  that is bundled with every Apache Ignite release and can be used as a default command line tool for SQL based interactions.
p
  | To prove that it&apos;s fairly simple to work with Ignite as with an SQL database using the tool, we recorded a short screencast for you:

h3 Ignite Persistence
p
p
  | Ignite native persistence keeps getting more attention and installs -- which is why the community released a feature requested by at least a dozen users. The feature allows enabling the persistence for specific data sets. Before Ignite version 2.3, the persistence could be enabled globally only.
p
  | Now, it&apos;s up to you to decide which data to persist and which to store in RAM only. The persistence can be configured via 
  a(href='https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/memory-configuration#section-data-regions' target='_blank') data regions
  |  as shown below:
p
  a(href='https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/memory-configuration#section-data-regions' target='_blank')
    img(src='/img/blog/0c7ce964-1218-49eb-bc9b-54a4725cabed.png' alt='persistence_cfg.png' style='display:block;margin:auto;width:60%;')
p
  | This data region will consume up to 500 MB of RAM and will store a superset of data on disk ensuring that no data loss happens in case of a crash or even if there is no more space left in RAM.
p
h3 Anything else?

p
  | Flip through 
  a(href='https://ignite.apache.org/releases/2.3.0/release_notes.html') our release notes
  |  to see all the changes and improvements available in Apache Ignite 2.3 -- and, for sure, download and use this version in production.
