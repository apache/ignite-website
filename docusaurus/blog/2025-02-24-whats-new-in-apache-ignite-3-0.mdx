## Installation and Management of Ignite 3

Apache Ignite 3.0 simplifies the installation and management process, making it more accessible for developers and administrators.

### New Ignite 3 Installation Packages

Apache Ignite 3.0 introduces modern Linux installation options:

- **Native Linux Packages**: Ignite now offers native RPM and DEB installation packages for Linux distributions, making it easier to install, upgrade, and manage through standard package managers.

### Interactive Unified Ignite CLI

The new Ignite 3.0 Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a streamlined experience for managing and interacting with the cluster.

- **Single CLI Tool**: The new CLI unifies cluster configuration, management, and SQL access in one tool, reducing complexity.
- **Scripting and Interactive Mode**: Users can execute scripts for automation or use an interactive shell (REPL) for direct interaction with the cluster.
- **Syntax Highlighting and Autocomplete**: The interactive mode includes enhanced usability features such as syntax highlighting and command autocompletion, making cluster management and troubleshooting easier.

### Dynamic Configuration Framework

Apache Ignite 3.0 replaces the legacy Spring XML-based configuration with a modern dynamic configuration system:

- **HOCON-based Configuration**: Human-Optimized Config Object Notation (HOCON) is now the standard configuration language, offering a more readable and flexible alternative to XML.
- **Dynamic Changes**: Configuration parameters can now be modified dynamically via the CLI or REST API without requiring a node restart, improving operational flexibility.

## Clients and APIs for Ignite 3

Apache Ignite 3.0 streamlines application development by unifying access across different clients and data models while ensuring flexibility and improving developer experience.

### Unified Ignite Clients

Previously, Ignite had a distinction between thin and thick clients, requiring developers to choose between lightweight connections or full-featured clients. In Ignite 3.0:

- **Lightweight Yet Fully Featured Ignite Clients**: New clients now support the full range of API features without the need to choose between thin or thick clients.
- **Consistent Experience Across Languages**: The new client model ensures consistency in API behavior across different programming languages, reducing learning curves and integration complexities.

### Table API and Unified Schema for Ignite 3

Ignite 3.0 enhances the way the data schema is managed and accessed across SQL and NoSQL interfaces.

- **Consistent Data Schema**: All data representations—SQL schema, key-value data types, and internal data storage—are now unified, eliminating the need for error-prone mappings between different models.
- **Table Views**: Table Views is a new API that allows applications to independently define how they access the database tables, increasing flexibility in choosing the client-side data model.
- **Record API**: Record API is a new alternative to Key-Value API that allows you to use a single data object without separating it into keys and values, which further increases flexibility of development.

### Asynchronous and Reactive Programming for Ignite 3

Ignite 3.0 enhances support for concurrent programming paradigms:

- **Language Features Support**: Client APIs support asynchronous and reactive programming with standard language constructs such as CompletableFuture and Flow API in Java or Task and IAsyncEnumerable in .NET.

### SQL Transactions in Ignite 3

Ignite 3.0 includes full transaction support in SQL:

- **Transactional SQL Support**: Full support for transactions allows you to bring more SQL applications to Ignite without compromising on consistency.
- **Combining SQL and NoSQL**: Both SQL and NoSQL-style APIs can be used together in a single transaction, enabling developers to choose the API they want to use at any given time.

## Architecture and Performance in Ignite 3

Apache Ignite 3.0 includes major architectural upgrades to improve cluster reliability and efficiency.

### Raft-based Consensus

Apache Ignite 3.0 now utilizes a Raft-based consensus mechanism for enhanced resiliency:

- **Improved Fault Tolerance**: Distributed consensus ensures stronger cluster stability and prevents split-brain scenarios.
- **Simplified Cluster Changes**: The new protocol reduces impact of node restarts and topology changes on the overall cluster, minimizing downtime and simplifying maintenance.

## Apache Ignite 3.0

Apache Ignite 3.0 is a major step forward, simplifying installation, improving configuration management, enhancing API usability, and significantly boosting performance.

- **For New Ignite Users**: Apache Ignite 3.0 provides an easier learning curve, streamlining first-time installation and configuration.
- **For Experienced Ignite Users**: Enhanced developer experience simplifies continuous improvement and maintenance.
